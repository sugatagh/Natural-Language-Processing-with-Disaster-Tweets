# Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets

Twitter is one of the most active social media platform that many people use to share occurrence of incidents including disasters. For example, if a fire breaks out in a building, many people around the particular location are likely to tweet about the incident. These tweets can send early alerts not only to people in the neighbourhood to evacuate, but also to the appropriate authority to take measures to minimize the loss, potentially saving lives. Thus the tweets indicating real disasters can be utilized for emergency disaster management to remarkable effect. In this project, we attempt to predict whether a given tweet indicates a real disaster or not.
